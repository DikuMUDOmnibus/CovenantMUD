There are many people that we wish to acknowledge for their contributions to
Covenant MUD.

* The original world setting was developed by Darryl Askew, Myles Skinner,
  and Bryant Telfer.

* The bulk of the current MUD development is being carried out by the
members of our wizlist, and we have received significant contributions
in the past from Blaine, Duithal, Lacdannon, Lancelord, Talish, and Wynn.

* Covenant MUD has, at its core, a stripped-down and much streamlined version
of SmaugFUSS. SMAUG was derived from MERC, which was itself derived from DIKU.
The original DIKU authors are: Katja Nyboe, Sebastian Hammer, Michael Seifert,
Hans Henrik Staerfeldt, and Tom Madsen. See HELP DIKU for full information.

We have also borrowed some interface design elements from DaleMUD. Please see
HELP CREDITS for details. 

Enjoy your stay!
